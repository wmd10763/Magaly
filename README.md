# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project uses predictive analytics and machine learning to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on health-related factors. By analyzing patient data, the goal is to build predictive models that can assist healthcare providers in early detection and intervention efforts. 

## Project Objectives

- Identify the most important health-related predictors of diabetes.
- Develop and compare at least two predictive models for diabetes diagnosis.
- Provide actionable insights to support healthcare professionals in screening and preventive strategies.

## Dataset Description

The analysis uses the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, which contains medical data from Pima Indian women aged 21 years and older. The dataset includes 768 records with the following variables:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic)

**Source:** This project uses the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from Kaggle:[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database?resource=download]
