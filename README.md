Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

Project Summary

This project uses predictive analytics and machine learning techniques to identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes based on health-related factors. By analyzing the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, the goal is to develop and compare predictive models to support healthcare professionals in screening and preventive care strategies.

Project Objectives

Identify the most important health-related predictors of diabetes.
Develop and compare the performance of at least two predictive models for diabetes diagnosis.
Provide actionable insights to assist healthcare providers in early detection and intervention.
Dataset Description

The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.
It contains 768 records of female patients aged 21 and older of Pima Indian heritage.
Each record includes 8 health-related measurements and a target variable indicating diabetes diagnosis (1 = diabetic, 0 = non-diabetic).

Variable	Description
Pregnancies	Number of times pregnant
Glucose	Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure	Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness	Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin	2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI	Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction	Diabetes pedigree function
Age	Age in years
Outcome	Class variable (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic)
